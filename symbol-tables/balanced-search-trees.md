# 2-3 tree

## Allow 1 or 2 keys per node.

* 2-node: one key, two children.
* 3-node: two keys, three children.

## Sysmetric order.

Inorder traversal yields keys in ascending order.

## Perfect balance

Every path from root to null link has same length.

# Search.

* Compare search key against keys in node.
* Find interval containing search key.
* Follow assciated link \(recursively\).
